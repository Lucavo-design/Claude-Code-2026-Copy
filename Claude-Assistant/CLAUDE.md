# Vincent's Digital Assistant Context

## What This File Is
This is the "master context" file that tells Claude who you are. When you start a Claude Code session, Claude automatically reads this file (if it's in your working directory) to understand your preferences, projects, and communication style.

Think of it like a "cheat sheet" about yourself that Claude references at the start of every conversation.
