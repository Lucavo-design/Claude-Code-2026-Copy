*A record of important decisions and the reasoning behind them.*

### Decision: Create a central "Claude-Assistant" folder structure
**What:** Set up a dedicated folder that all Claude interfaces can access
**Why:** Different Claude products don't automatically share information. Having a central folder gives them a common "source of truth."
**Alternatives considered:** 
- Just using Claude.ai Projects (limited to web/mobile)
- Keeping everything in GitHub (too code-focused)
**Result:** Created ~/Desktop/Claude Code 2026/Claude-Assistant/ as a mockup
